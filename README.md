# cg-li

Mathematician transitioning to algorithm engineering and data systems.  
I focus on clear, correct implementations and reproducible reasoning.
- This homepage is currently a work in progress.

## Skills
- Languages: Python, SQL, Java  
- Areas: Algorithms & Data Structures, Graph Theory, Query Design (joins, windows, CTEs)  
- Tooling: Git/GitHub, JDK 17+, PostgreSQL/MySQL  

## Highlight Repositories
- **algorithms** — Java implementations from coursework and LeetCode, with complexity notes and runnable instructions.  
  https://github.com/cg-li/algorithms
- **sql** — LeetCode SQL solutions organized by topic, with portable patterns.  
  https://github.com/cg-li/sql  

## Academic Background
- Conducted and led original mathematical research on complex graph structures, identifying a limitation in a prior approach and proposing an alternative insight that addressed a key computational bottleneck in the (2,3)-linkage problem. Special thanks to Fudan University math department.  
- Conducted original mathematical research on high dimensional statistics, focusing on oracle inequalities of sparsity structure and the selection of the penalty term.
- After careful consideration of long-term career direction, I made a strategic decision to leave academia and transition toward algorithm engineering and data systems.


## Current Focus
- Refining SQL solutions with commentary and difficulty tags  
- Adding tests and benchmarks for algorithm modules  
- Preparing a concise portfolio aligned to algorithm-engineer / data roles in HK/Shanghai
